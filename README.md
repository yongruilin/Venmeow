As of October 2024, Venmo introduced Schedule Send/Request - https://newsroom.paypal-corp.com/2024-10-09-Venmo-Introduces-the-Ability-to-Schedule-Payments-and-Requests. However, Venmo still doesn't support scheduling requests that span over a month.

Automatically send or request recurring payments using Github Actions and Venmo API.

Currently running workflows in Github Actions can be found [here](https://github.com/zhaonian/Venmeow/actions)
